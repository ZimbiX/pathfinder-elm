# PathFinder Elm

## Elm

I'm using this an opportunity to learn Functional Programming! :D Elm seems like a good choice, and I'm finding the [Elm Guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org/) very approachable.

My hope is for this modern rewrite to eventually be able to run on smartphones as an installable app.

## History

This is my fourth attempt at writing an implementation of the board game, PathFinder. See my original version on my old website for more info on the game: http://www.zimbico.net/games/pathfinder/

Versions:

- GameMaker (the most complete)
- GameMaker Studio (Android spike)
- Pascal using SwinGame - for a uni project
- This one!
